    "The Boilerboard is custom development board that is debuting at Boilermake VI. It is built around an ESP8266-12E, which is a low-cost wifi module. It is flashed with Micropython which is an implementation of Python 3 that is optimised to run on microcontrollers. It is based on the popular Node-MCU boards with some extra features. Notably, an OLED screen and IO expander connected to an I2C bus and a AA power supply."
